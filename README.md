# ModWorkshop Manager

This repo contains a very early version of the mod manager. It barely does anything and you shouldn't be using it yet.

The mod manager is built on .NET 8 with the Avalonia framework.

To test the mod manager, use the modworkshop dev site (https://dev.modworkshop.net). It has the mod manager's URI scheme added to it.
